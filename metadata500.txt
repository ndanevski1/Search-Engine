NNDSS - TABLE 1Z. Pertussis to Poliomyelitis, paralytic
NNDSS - TABLE 1Z. Pertussis to Poliomyelitis, paralytic - 2020. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.  Notice: Data from California published in week 29 for years 2019 and 2020 were incomplete when originally published on July 24, 2020. On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a "U" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period.   Note:  This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.   Footnotes: U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data. -: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC. N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction. NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. NC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks. * Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. †Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).  § The pertussis case definition was modified by CSTE effective January 1, 2020. Criteria were modified increasing sensitivity for case ascertainment such that case counts may increase.

Vital Signs: Rent Payments – by city
VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR Rent Payments (EC8)  FULL MEASURE NAME Median rent payment  LAST UPDATED August 2019  DESCRIPTION Rent payments refer to the cost of leasing an apartment or home and serves as a measure of housing costs for individuals who do not own a home. The data reflect the median monthly rent paid by Bay Area households across apartments and homes of various sizes and various levels of quality. This differs from advertised rents for available apartments, which usually are higher. Note that rent can be presented using nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) dollar values; data are presented inflation-adjusted to reflect changes in household purchasing power over time.  DATA SOURCE U.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census 1970-2000 https://nhgis.org  Note: Count 1 and Count 2; Form STF1; Form SF3a  U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey 2005-2017 http://api.census.gov  Note: Form B25058; 1-YR  Bureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index 1970-2017 http://www.bls.gov/data/ Note: All Urban Consumers Data Table (by metro)  CONTACT INFORMATION vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov  METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) Rent data reflects median rent payments rather than list rents (refer to measure definition above). Larger geographies (metro and county) rely upon ACS 1-year data, while smaller geographies rely upon ACS 5-year rolling average data. 1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed by ABAG staff as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent. Metro area boundaries reflects today’s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.  Inflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rent payments have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.

General Building Permits
List of issued building permits from the City of Edmonton - Sustainable Development Department for the public to do construction or maintenance on a structure located in the City. Note - All records start from January 1, 2009.  Please note : the decision was made to not release applicant information on this dataset as it was seen as a potential privacy issue. For instance, if a high profile member of the public were to apply for a permit, their name (and consequently address) would show up on this table and become easily searchable by the public.  We viewed this as a potential issue and decided to publish the dataset without applicant information.

2012 Census - Population By Mode Of Transportation (Neighbourhood)
All Census information is as of April 1, 2012.  Ages of residents are effective April 1, 2012.  No data on any individual residence will be released.  To protect the privacy of individuals, data is compiled and presented at the city, ward and neighbourhood level only.  Neighbourhood results with a population under 49 are not posted to protect the information collected.  The designation of “No Response” includes households from which no census data could be collected or only partial data was available.  Bulk-count data from multiple-resident facilities (such as group homes, transient drop-in centres, residential hotels or criminal detention centres) may be limited when personal information cannot be obtained (i.e. information is not available or cannot be released by the facility administration).

Downtown Tax Revenue by Consumer Activity Period
NOTE: Effective March 1, 2019, the Mesa tax rate increased from 1.75% to 2.0%.   This dataset contains revenue for active Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) taxpayers (also known as Sales Tax) and Transient Lodging Tax (TLT) taxpayers (also known as Hotel / Motel Tax) located in downtown Mesa. To see a map of downtown Mesa boundaries see the "Source Link" below. Revenues are grouped by Reporting Period Year and Reporting Period Month. Reporting period generally refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was received/posted by the City. As taxpayers make payments and other corrections to previous periods, over time monthly revenue numbers fluctuate. Generally speaking, monthly revenue numbers for consumer activity become more accurate over time.
Forestry Risk Assessments
Risk Assessments are sub-components of Inspection records where Type = Level 2. Trees are inspected in accordance with Parks' Tree Risk Management program. For a given defect identified on a tree, 3 rating variables are selected to arrive at a Total Rating. Because multiple defects can be noted on a tree, multiple Risk Assessment records can be related to one Inspection.

Data for Efficacy of Nitrile Disinfection (Phi6)
In the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, international organizations provided conflicting recommendations for disinfecting surfaces contaminated by uncontrolled patient spills. We compared the efficacy of four chlorine solutions (sodium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high ­test hypochlorite, and generated hypochlorite) for disinfection of three surface types (stainless steel, heavy duty tarp, and nitrile), with and without pre­cleaning practices (pre­wiping and/or covering) and soil load. The test organisms were E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6. All tests achieved a minimum of 5.9­ and 3.1­log removal in E. coli and Phi6, respectively. A 15­-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine was sufficient to ensure less than 8 Phi6 PFU/cm2 in all tests. While chlorine types were equally efficacious with and without soil load, variation was seen by surface type. Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy ­duty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts. Our results support the recommendation of a 15-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine, independently of chlorine type, surface, pre­-cleaning practices, and organic matter, as an efficacious measure to interrupt disease transmission from uncontrolled spills in Ebola outbreaks.

Remote Learning by Town
This dataset includes the percentage of public school students PK-12 who are fully remote by town during a given week of the school year.   The percent of students remote for a town is determined based on all districts and Approved Private Special Education Programs (APSEPs) located in that town. CT Technical Education and Career Districts (CTECS) and Regional Education Service Center School Districts (RESCs) are excluded from this calculation because they have schools in several towns. For towns that are part of a regional school district for all grades or some grades, the percent remote for each member town will reflect the same value based on the total of all districts and APSEPs in those member towns.  In some cases, multiple towns have been grouped together to calculate the number and percent of students who are fully remote; the towns included in the calculation are noted in the column called "Remote calculation town group."  When an asterisk is displayed, data have been suppressed to safeguard student confidentiality, or to ensure that statistics based on a very small sample size are not interpreted as equally representative as those based on a sufficiently larger sample size. For more information on CSDE data suppression policies, please visit http://edsight.ct.gov/relatedreports/BDCRE%20Data%20Suppression%20Rules.pdf.

2013 - 2015 New York State English Language Arts (ELA) Exam
(Grades 3 - 8)    Notes   Starting in 2013, the NY State Education Department (NYSED) changed the exams to be Common Core aligned. Results on earlier exams from 2006-2012 can be found at this link: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm    Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for "matched" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, "matched" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th – 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.  In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.  For 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 & 2015, they are not included.  Charter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults    In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.   A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempted from taking the 7th or 8th grade State math assessment.  Former English Language Learners includes any students who were classified as English Language Learners in at least one of the previous two school years.

This spreadsheet contains detailed information regarding active public-private partnerships in FY 2015.  This dataset is part of the data asset that brings together information collected since 2001 on Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) that have been supported by USAID. For the purposes of this dataset a PPP is defined as a USAID-supported development project or initiative which engages the private sector (including corporations, foundations, and other non-governmental actors) as a core resource partner. Due to changes in Agency data collection systems, standards, and internal organization, the data has been collected according to different mechanisms, definitions, and timeframes from 2001-2016, and therefore cannot be considered to be comprehensive of all PPPs during this period.

The project’s objective is to document movement patterns and survival rates of Chinook salmon, steelhead, green sturgeon, and other fish from several sources in the Central Valley of California. Juvenile salmonids from hatcheries or wild caught are implanted with small acoustic transmitters and the location of the fish are recorded on receivers that are placed throughout the watershed from Redding to the Golden Gate. Over 70 receiver locations with over 150 receivers monitor the movement of these fish. These receivers record the date, time, and unique identification number of transmitters that pass within listening range of the receivers. The first acoustic tagging studies began in 2006 and continue today.

Enhancing Microsimulation Models for Improved Work Zone Planning: Car-Following Data from Northern Virginia (Runs)
The data describe freeway car-following behavior (such as velocity, acceleration, and relative position) for the car-following instances observed during 59 data collection runs, performed through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center’s (TFHRC) Living Laboratory (LL). Data were collected using an Instrumented Research Vehicle (IRV) along freeways in northern Virginia to better understand work zone driver behaviors. The USDOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) identified, isolated, and classified individual car following instances from within the raw datasets (classification parameters included roadway type, level of congestion, and speed limit), then processed, refined, and cleaned the dataset.   This table contains metadata about each data collection run.

Vital Signs: Population – by region shares
VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  Population (LU1)    FULL MEASURE NAME  Population estimates    LAST UPDATED  September 2016    DESCRIPTION			  Population is a measurement of the number of residents that live in a given geographical area, be it a neighborhood, city, county or region. 				    DATA SOURCES		  U.S. Census Bureau  1960-1990  Decennial Census  http://factfinder2.census.gov    California Department of Finance  1961-2016  Population and Housing Estimates  http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  All legal boundaries and names for Census geography (metropolitan statistical area, county, city, tract) are as of January 1, 2010, released beginning November 30, 2010 by the U.S. Census Bureau. A priority development area (PDA) is a locally-designated infill area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are as current as July 2016. Population estimates for PDAs were derived from Census population counts at the block group level for 2000-2014 and at the tract level for 1970-1990.     Population estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average.         Estimates of density for tracts and PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.     Annual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.    The following is a list of cities and towns by geographical area:   Big Three: San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland  Bayside: Alameda, Albany, Atherton, Belmont, Belvedere, Berkeley, Brisbane, Burlingame, Campbell, Colma, Corte Madera, Cupertino, Daly City, East Palo Alto, El Cerrito, Emeryville, Fairfax, Foster City, Fremont, Hayward, Hercules, Hillsborough, Larkspur, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Menlo Park, Mill Valley, Millbrae, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Mountain View, Newark, Pacifica, Palo Alto, Piedmont, Pinole, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Richmond, Ross, San Anselmo, San Bruno, San Carlos, San Leandro, San Mateo, San Pablo, San Rafael, Santa Clara, Saratoga, Sausalito, South San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Tiburon, Union City, Vallejo, Woodside  InlandCoastalDelta: American Canyon, Benicia, Clayton, Concord, Cotati, Danville, Dublin, Lafayette, Martinez, Moraga, Napa, Novato, Orinda, Petaluma, Pleasant Hill, Pleasanton, Rohnert Park, San Ramon, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Walnut Creek, Antioch, Brentwood, Calistoga, Cloverdale, Dixon, Fairfield, Gilroy, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Livermore, Morgan Hill, Oakley, Pittsburg, Rio Vista, Sonoma, St. Helena, Suisun City, Vacaville, Windsor, Yountville  Unincorporated: all unincorporated towns

NNDSS - TABLE 1II. Tetanus to Trichinellosis
NNDSS - TABLE 1II. Tetanus to Trichinellosis - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.     Note:   This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.     Footnotes:  U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.  -: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.  N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.  NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.  NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.  Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.  Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.  * Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.   † Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).

Police-reported incidents of human trafficking, by province and territory, 2009 to 2018 / Affaires de traite de personnes déclarées par la police, par province et territoire, 2009 à 2018
Many incidents identified as human trafficking by police are not processed as such in courts. Other Canadian research suggests that charges of human trafficking may not be pursued as such once they come before the courts. Criminal court cases involving human trafficking, on average, involved more charges, took longer to complete, and were less likely to result in a guilty decision when compared with criminal court cases for other violent offences. The added complexity and lower likelihood of successful prosecution of human trafficking cases may influence the decision to pursue charges from the outset of a court case. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/200623/dq200623b-eng.pdf?st=HmJC1Imu / De nombreux incidents identifiés comme traite d'êtres humains par la police ne sont pas traités comme tels devant les tribunaux. D'autres recherches canadiennes suggèrent que les accusations de traite de personnes peuvent ne pas être poursuivies en tant que telles une fois qu'elles sont portées devant les tribunaux. Les affaires pénales liées à la traite de personnes, en moyenne, impliquaient plus d'accusations, prenaient plus de temps à être traitées et étaient moins susceptibles d'aboutir à une décision de culpabilité par rapport aux affaires pénales pour d'autres infractions violentes. La complexité accrue et la moindre probabilité de succès des poursuites dans les affaires de traite des êtres humains peuvent influencer la décision de porter des accusations dès le début d'un procès. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/200623/dq200623b-fra.pdf?st=HmJC1Imu

Vital Signs: Vulnerability To Sea Level Rise - Tracts Shapefile
VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise (EN11) FULL MEASURE NAME Share of population living in zones at risk from various sea level rise forecast scenarios LAST UPDATED July 2017 DESCRIPTION Vulnerability to sea level rise refers to the share of the historical and current Bay Area population located in areas at risk from forecasted sea level rise over the coming decades. Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods. DATA SOURCE San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission/Metropolitan Transportation Commission ART (Adaption to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise Analysis and Mapping Project (2017) 2017 Sea Level Rise Maps http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/ CONTACT INFORMATION vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) Projected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC’s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data. Because census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise. For the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available. More information on this approach is available here: http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/ Sea level rise analysis for metro areas reflects local, as opposed to global, sea level rise. Recent data has shown sea level is rising faster in the southeast region of the United States. Regional differences in the rate of sea level rise. More information and data related to the rate of sea level rise for different coastal regions is available here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel-global-local.html

Driver Feedback Sign - DFS101
Driver Feedback Sign DFS101  Latitude: 53.54221 Longitude: -113.57468  The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).  Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.  Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows: - Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals - Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins) - Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting) - Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts) - The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.  Things to note:  DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not. DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr. DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr. DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.

Rate of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome per 1,000 Newborn Stays by County of Residence FYs 2016-2017 Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4)
Countywide counts of newborn hospital stays with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and countywide rates of newborn hospital stays with (NAS) per 1,000 newborn stays.  Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, or neonatal drug withdrawal, is an array of problems that develops shortly after birth in newborns who were exposed to addictive drugs, most often opioids, while in the mother’s womb. Withdrawal signs develop because these newborns are no longer exposed to the drug for which they have become physically dependent. This analysis is restricted to newborns with Pennsylvania-state residence who were hospitalized in Pennsylvania hospitals.  Disclaimer: Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4) database contains statewide hospital discharge data submitted to PHC4 by Pennsylvania hospitals.

Baseline Study of Food for Peace Title II Development Food Assistance Program in Segamil and Paisano in Guatemala--Household Description Data
This dataset describes the households and their members surveyed as part of the Baseline Study of Food for Peace Title II Development Food Assistance Program in  in Segamil and Paisano in Guatemala.  It has 36 columns and 37,454 rows.  In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Guatemala.  The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure populations in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International, to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  The results were also used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to improve the understanding of the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.  The data asset is comprised of six datasets: Agricultural Practices, Child Health, Household Description, Maternal Health and Household Sanitation, Food Consumption and the sample weights to be applied during analysis.

2016 Building Energy Benchmarking
Seattle’s Building Energy Benchmarking and Reporting Program (SMC 22.920) requires owners of non-residential and multifamily buildings (20,000 square feet or larger) to track energy performance and annually report to the City of Seattle. Buildings account for 33% of Seattle's core emissions. The benchmarking policy supports Seattle's goals to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings. In 2013, the City of Seattle adopted a Climate Action Plan to achieve zero net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosing of building performance are foundational elements of creating more market value for energy efficiency. Per Ordinance (125000), starting with 2015 energy use performance reporting, the City of Seattle will make the data for all building 20,000 SF and larger available annually. This update to the benchmarking mandate was passed by Seattle City Council on February 29, 2016.  If you have questions or comments on the data, email us at energybenchmarking@seattle.gov and include Open Data in the subject line.

Vital Signs: Street Pavement Condition - by County (Updated August 2018)
VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR Street Pavement Condition (T16)  FULL MEASURE NAME Pavement condition index (PCI)  LAST UPDATED August 2018  DESCRIPTION Street pavement condition, more commonly referred to as the pavement condition index (PCI), reflects the quality of pavement on local streets and roads in the region. Calculated using a three-year moving average, PCI ranges from zero (failed) to 100 (brand-new) and has been used as a regional indicator of pavement preservation for over a decade.  DATA SOURCE Metropolitan Transportation Commission: StreetSaver  CONTACT INFORMATION vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov  METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) Pavement condition index (PCI) relies upon a three-year moving average for regional, county, and city PCI to improve the reliability of the PCI data on an annual basis. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility. Segment PCI data is collected on a rolling basis but is imputed for interim years based on facility age and treatments using the MTC StreetSaver system. Due to the lack of reported PCI data in 2007, the city of Palo Alto is not included in the Regional Distribution chart.
Development Permits
List of development permits from the City of Edmonton - Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development Department.     Development permits approve the use of a site, as well as the size and location of any buildings or structures. It is written approval from the City that development plans meet the Edmonton Zoning Bylaw regulations. An approved development permit is required before application for a building permit to construct the building or structure, or to apply for a business licence.    Some permits are combination permits. They combine both a development permit and a building permit in one application. This data set only represents the outcome of the development permit application. Building permit data is available through the General Building Permits dataset.    Additional information to help understand more about Development Permits:    Development Permits -   www.edmonton.ca/developmentpermits    What is Zoning? brochure which offers a basic explanation of what zoning is, and how it shapes neighbourhoods and the city -   https://www.edmonton.ca/documents/What_is_Zoning_Final.pdf    Edmonton’s Zoning Bylaw 12800 -  www.edmonton.ca/zoningbylaw    How to Respond to a Land Development Application -   https://www.cityofedmontoninfill.ca/public/download/documents/34672

Austin's Small Scale Green Infrastructure
A rain garden is a low area that absorbs and filters rain water runoff that comes from roofs, sidewalks, and driveways. Rain runs off the hard surfaces, collects in the shallow depression, and slowly soaks into the soil.  They are usually planted with colorful native plants and grasses. Every little bit helps to conserve water.  Currently we are tracking rain garden bioswale, cistern, and green roofs.
Driver Feedback Sign - DFS142
Driver Feedback Sign DFS142    Latitude: 53.55709  Longitude: -113.52142    The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).    Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.    Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:  - Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals  - Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)  - Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)  - Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)  - The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.    Things to note:    DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.  DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.  DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.  DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.

Strategic Measure_Number of buildings, roadways, and properties with reduced flood risk due to City efforts
Strategic Direction 2023 (SD23) Measure HE.E.5.a reports the number and percentage of buildings, roadways, and properties whose exposure to high flooding risk have decreased due to City efforts. Flood risk can occur during rain events when creeks overflow their banks (creek flooding) or when the capacity of older storm drains and small channels is overwhelmed (local flooding). The Watershed Protection Department helps reduce flood risk through the implementation of structural solutions (e.g., detention ponds, low water crossing upgrades, floodwalls, flow diversion, storm drain improvements) and non-structural solutions (e.g., property acquisition or "buyouts" of properties with severe flood risk, permanent road closures).

Final Performance Evaluation of the USAID/Jamaica Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI), Household Perception Survey Data
Household perception survey data from Final Performance Evaluation of the USAID/Jamaica Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI)    The purpose of this evaluation of the Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI) is to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives and gain lessons for implementation of ongoing or future programs. The evaluation sought to identify: 1) implementation challenges, corrective actions to project management, and progress towards achieving expected results; 2) the factors that contributed to the success/failure of the different project components; 3) the effect of the activity on men and women; and 4) the extent to which SEBI contributed to the local social enterprise (SE) policy environment. The evaluation will serve to inform the United States Agency for International Development Jamaica Mission’s (USAID/Jamaica) Local Partner Development (LPD) program under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) as well as the Social Enterprise Jamaica (SEJA), which is in the process of being registered as a non-governmental organization (NGO), with a view to continuing some of the work of SEBI once the project ends in December 2018. The exact nature of SEJA’s activities is unclear, although the Evaluation Team (ET) understands that the focus could primarily be on incubation services for SEs under the LPD program.    SEBI was initiated by the Jamaica National Foundation (JNF) and jointly funded by JNF and USAID. The rationale for USAID’s decision to support SEBI in Jamaica, implemented by (JNF), was based on several important factors at the time, namely: 1) low levels of business competitiveness and productivity; 2) a stagnant economy; 3) a high debt burden; and 4) high levels of crime in the country. The genesis of SEBI was in JNF’s observation that not-for-profit and other organizations operating in the social sector were struggling to deliver their core services mainly due to a reliance on grants and donations. The underlying goal therefore was to introduce the social enterprise model to these organizations so that they could start generating their own income and become less reliant on grants and donations. SEBI began in July 2012 and is due for completion at the end of December 2018, following three extensions agreed in Modifications 2, 3, and 5 in the Cooperative Agreement (CA).     The ET pursued three separate, yet interlinked, data collection activities that formed the basis of its methodological approach to conducting the SEBI evaluation as follows:  1.	Face-to-face meetings on site with SEBI’s incubator and accelerator beneficiary clients as well as representatives from key stakeholders,  including national and local government, the private sector, international community, civil society, NGOs, and business associations and agencies. In total, the ET met with 29 beneficiaries (20 incubators and 13 accelerators) and 30 stakeholders. Team members used semi-structured questionnaires to record answers for later comparative analysis and cross-reference purposes with findings from the other data collection methods, mentioned below.   2.	The ET hosted four focus group discussions (FGDs) in the parishes (Trelawny, St. James, Westmoreland and Manchester) and one in Kingston with selected groups of SEBI indirect beneficiaries. In total, 31 participants attended the FGDs, providing views and responses to questions which were noted for later cross-referencing with findings from the direct beneficiary and public awareness surveys.   3.	Two surveys were carried out by Market Research Services Limited (MRSL), based in Kingston, on behalf of the ET (see Annex 6 – Survey Reports for complete analysis of the findings from both surveys). Final Performance Evaluation of the USAID/Jamaica Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI)    The purpose of this evaluation of the Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI) is to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives and gain lessons for implemen

AFSC/ABL: Southeast Coastal Monitoring Survey (SECM)-juvenile salmon and associated epipelagic ichthyofauna in the marine waters of Southeast Alaska: Catch View
SECM research was initiated in the spring of 1997, just prior to the onset of a strong El Nio event, and has continued annually. SECM sampling occurs around Icy Strait (58N, 136W) in the northern region and have been sustained for 18 years. This is a principal migration corridor for salmon that transit dynamic tidal and oceanographic features to offshore waters as juveniles and return in subsequent years as adults. SECM researchers have compiled a multi-year time series of biophysical data associated with juvenile salmon culled from monthly sampling intervals in May, June, July, and August. Juvenile salmon and ecologically-related species are sampled with a surface trawl and associated oceanographic measurements are taken. This time series includes data on: Temperature and salinity profiles, Surface nutrients and chlorophyll, Zooplankton (upper 20-m and integrated), Size, abundance, and origin of salmon  Potential predators of juvenile salmon, Some of these biophysical data are being used to forecast pink salmon returns to Southeast Alaska and to evaluate recent trends in commercial salmon harvest and ocean survival within the region. These analyses also explore the impact of large-scale, climate-driven processes on salmon year-class strength.

Vital Signs: Ozone Concentrations – by sensor location (updated June 2017)
VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  Ozone Concentrations (EN2)    FULL MEASURE NAME  Ozone concentrations (O3)    LAST UPDATED  June 2017    DESCRIPTION  Ozone concentrations refer to the quantity of ozone (O3) molecules in the air we breathe. In the Bay Area, ozone is measured by over a dozen monitoring stations that record hourly concentrations used to determine compliance with national standards. These hourly data are used to calculate eight-hour peak ozone levels for the fourth-worst day of the year, the most common indicator of ozone performance. This dataset includes regional and sensor-specific concentrations, as well as metropolitan area data.    DATA SOURCE  Bay Area Air Quality Management District  1970-2016  Air Quality Sensor Data  http://www.baaqmd.gov/about-air-quality/air-quality-summaries    CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  Data is collected at specific sensor sites operated by the Air District that capture the concentration of ozone in the air; sensor locations may change over the years and thus only minor relocations are shown as the same station in this analysis (e.g., sensor moved across the street from its prior location). Data are used to calculate the 8-hour peak concentration for ozone. The fourth-highest day of the year is identified and then reported as a three-year rolling average to minimize noise associated with any given year. These averaged are compared to the national air quality standard to determine compliance. The worst location site may shift from year to year depending on which sensor location had the highest levels of ozone over that particular time period.

Vital Signs: Daily Miles Traveled - by metro area (per-capita)
VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  Daily Miles Traveled (T15)    FULL MEASURE NAME  Per-capita vehicle miles traveled    LAST UPDATED  July 2017    DESCRIPTION  Daily miles traveled, commonly referred to as vehicle miles traveled (VMT), reflects the total and per-person number of miles traveled in personal vehicles on a typical weekday. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional and county tables for per-capita vehicle miles traveled.    DATA SOURCE  Federal Highway Administration: Highway Statistics Series  2015  Table HM-71; limited to urbanized areas  https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm    U.S. Census Bureau: Summary File 1  2010  http://factfinder2.census.gov      CONTACT INFORMATION  vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov    METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  "Vehicle miles traveled reflects the mileage accrued within the county and not necessarily the residents of that county; even though most trips are due to local residents, additional VMT can be accrued by through-trips. City data was thus discarded due to this limitation and the analysis only examine county and regional data, where through-trips are generally less common.    The metropolitan area comparison was performed by summing all of the urbanized areas within each metropolitan area (9-nine region for the San Francisco Bay Area and the primary MSA for all others). For the metro analysis, no VMT data is available outside of other urbanized areas; it is only available for intraregional analysis purposes.    VMT per capita is calculated by dividing VMT by an estimate of the traveling population. The traveling population does not include people living in institutionalized facilities, which are defined by the Census. Because institutionalized population is not estimated each year, the proportion of people living in institutionalized facilities from the 2010 Census was applied to the total population estimates for all years."
Driver Feedback Sign - DFS199
Driver Feedback Sign DFS199    Latitude: 53.499861  Longitude: -113.626292    The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).    Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.    Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:  - Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals  - Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)  - Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)  - Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)  - The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.    Things to note:    DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.  DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.  DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.  DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.
